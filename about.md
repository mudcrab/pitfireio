## Hi! ##

### My name is **Jevgeni**, and I am a web developer from Tallinn. ###

Currently, my main focus is on the visual side of things, although I can manage developing the backend just fine.

I can code in a variety of languages, but consider myself especially proficient in JavaScript, be it on front-end side of things (jQuery, Backbone) or the backend (Node + Express).

On my spare time I like working out in the gym, cooking or working on my side projects.

For in-depth information, check out my [résumé]({{ site.static_location }}/cv.pdf).
